# This is Currency Converter Webapp

This is a simple currency converter that implements a request for a <b>free api 
and outputs this information to the page.</b> The interaction with the user is worked out, 
when he enters data into inputs he immediately gets a response based on the information 
received from the api. It is also possible to select currencies, and when they are changed, 
the output changes immediately. It is also impossible to enter values less than zero.
